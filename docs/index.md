| **Build your own OGC Web Processing Service for geospatial data analysis.** |

# Welcome to Birdhouse
Birdhouse tools enable you to build your own customised
[Web Processing Service](http://opengeospatial.org/standards/wps)
application in support of web-based geospatial (climate) data analysis. Birdhouse offers you:

* A [Cookiecutter template](https://cookiecutter-birdhouse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to create your own [PyWPS](http://pywps.org/) compute service.
* An [Ansible script](https://ansible-wps-playbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to deploy a full-stack PyWPS service.
* A web-based application, [Phoenix](https://pyramid-phoenix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and ...
* ... a Python library, [Birdy](https://birdy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
  suitable for [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks to interact with WPS compute services.
* An OWS security proxy, [Twitcher](https://twitcher.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
  to provide access control to OGC/WPS compute services.

We already have several WPS compute services for climate data analysis, like [FlyingPigeon](https://flyingpigeon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Finch](https://github.com/bird-house/finch).
